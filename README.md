## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- PostgreSQL installed and running on your machine
- Git installed on your system

### Installation

1. Clone the EcoGuard repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/henriettetuombe/EcoGuard.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd EcoGuard
    ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    # Using virtualenv
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Using venv
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Database Setup

1. Create a new PostgreSQL database for EcoGuard:

    ```bash
    createdb ecoguard_db
    ```

2. Set up your environmental variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

    ```plaintext
    # Example .env file
    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost/ecoguard_db
    ```

    Replace `your_secret_key` with a secure secret key for your Django application, `username` and `password` with your PostgreSQL credentials, and `ecoguard_db` with the name of your PostgreSQL database.

    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
